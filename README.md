# Huff puzzles with bitwise operations

Managing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode frequently demands a solid grasp of bitwise operations, including `&`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`, `^` and `~`. This collection of challenges draws significant inspiration from the [RareSkills Huff Puzzles](https://github.com/rareskills/huff-puzzles). In addition to providing a practical introduction to the [Huff language](https://huff.sh), the tasks within this repository serve to enhance comprehension of bitwise operations in the context of Ethereum development.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you've installed the Huff Compiler as outlined in the [Huff Docs](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/installing/#installing-huff).

TLDR:

    curl -L get.huff.sh | bash

then:

     huffup

To verify your installation, run `huffc --help`. This should print a list of available commands for the huff compiler cli.

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

    forge install

## How to play

Go to [GetBitAt.huff](https://github.com/brozorec/huff-bitwise-puzzles/blob/main/src/GetBitAt.huff) in the src folder and edit it as follows

```c
#define macro MAIN() = takes(0) returns(0) {
    // your Huff code goes here
}
```

Then run the test with

    forge test -vvv --mc GetBitAt

You should see something like this

    Running 1 test for test/GetBitAt.t.sol:GetBitAt
    [PASS] testGetBitAt() (gas: 5358)
    Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 4.56s
